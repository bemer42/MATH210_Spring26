\question Stokes' Theorem is written so eloquently in my handwriting below.  Replace the figure below with a typed out version of the theorem.  Here are some commands you may need: \verb|\nabla|, \verb|\cdot|, \verb|\partial|, \verb|\Omega|, \verb|\sigma|, \verb|\oint|, among others.  Also, when typing vectors, the symbols are bolded and do not need the little arrow on top, use \verb|\boldsymbol{}|. \\ 

\textsc{Solution:} \\

\underline{Stokes' Theorem:} Let $\Omega$ be an orientable piecewise-smooth surface that is bounded by a simple, closed, piecewise-smooth boundary curve $\partial \Omega$ with positive orientation.  Let $\boldsymbol{F}$ be a vector field whose components have continuous partial derivatives on an open region in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that contains $\Omega$.  Then 

\[ \oint_{\partial \Omega} \boldsymbol{F} \cdot \boldsymbol{T}\, ds = \iint_{\Omega} \left( \nabla \times \boldsymbol{F}\right) \cdot d\boldsymbol{\sigma}. \]

\question Suppose we're trying to maximize the volume of a squared-based box.  In part $a$, we must supply all sides of the box.  In parts $b$ and $c$, there exists natural borders where we do not need to supply certain sides of the box.  Summarize the three cases below for maximizing volume, $V$, given the surface area, $A$.  For each case, provide the optimal dimensions, $x$ and $y$, and the maximum volume, $V_{max}$, all of which should be a function of $A$.  Create a Python code that will produce a graph with three curves on it, where each curve is $V_{max}$ versus $A$ for each case below.  The legend should decipher each part.  Include the figure in your write-up below.  


\begin{center}

\end{center}

\textsc{Solution:}  The three parts to this problem can be solved simultaneously by introducing a parameter that represents the number of sides that are occupied by walls.  Let $n$ be a value from the set $\{0, 1, 2\}$, then the surface area constraint of this problem can be generalized to the following equation: 
\[ (4-n)xy + 2x^2 = A \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad y = \frac{1}{4-n} \left(\frac{A}{x} - 2x \right). \]
Here, $n = 0$ corresponds to part $a$, $n = 1$ corresponds to part $b$, and $n = 2$ corresponds to part $c$.  In each case,we wish to maximize the volume, $V = x^2y$.  Substituting $y$ into this equation gives the single variable function
\[ V(x) = x^2 \left[ \frac{1}{4-n} \left(\frac{A}{x} - 2x \right) \right] \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad V(x) = \frac{1}{4-n} \left(Ax - 2x^3\right). \]

This function has a unique global minimum value at the critical point that satisfies $V'(x) = 0$: 
\[\frac{1}{4-n} \left( A - 6x^2\right) = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad x_{max} = \sqrt{\frac{A}{6}}. \]
We note here that the optimal length of the square base doesn't depend on $n$.  However, the height, given by $y$, does depend on $n$: 
\begin{align*}
y_{max} & =  \frac{1}{4-n} \left(\frac{A}{x_{max}} - 2x_{max} \right) \\ 
& =  \frac{1}{4-n} \left(\frac{A}{\sqrt{\frac{A}{6}}} - 2\sqrt{\frac{A}{6}}\right) \\ 
& = \frac{1}{4-n} \left( \sqrt{6}\sqrt{A} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}} \sqrt{A} \right)\\
& = \frac{1}{4-n} \left( \frac{6}{\sqrt{6}} - \frac{2}{\sqrt{6}}\right) \sqrt{A}\\
& = \frac{4}{4-n}\sqrt{\frac{A}{6}} \end{align*} 

Finally, using the optimal dimensions for $x$ and $y$ above, we can formulate an expression for the maximal volume: 
\[ V_{max} = \left(\sqrt{\frac{A}{6}}\right)^2\left(\frac{4}{4-n} \sqrt{\frac{A}{6}}\right) \qquad \Rightarrow\qquad V_{max} = \frac{4}{4-n}\left( \frac{A}{6}\right)^{3/2}. \]

Ultimately, we find that the square base always has the same length for any number of sides taken away.  However, the height of the box will grow with $n$, doubling in size when $n$ changes from $0$ to $2$.  Likewise, the optimal volume increases with $n$ and will double in size when $n$ changes from $0$ to $2$.  Figure \ref{Max_Volume_Graph} depicts each part below and shows how the maximum volume, $V_{max}$, changes with surface area, $A$.

\caption{Optimal volume denoted by $V_{max}$ as it relates to surface area, $A$.  We can see that as $n$ increases, the maximum volume increases more rapidly with $A$, indicating that for any given surface area, the volume contained is larger when walls are used as sides. }

\question Consider the object below that consists of a cylinder with a spherical cap and a reinforced ``ring" around where the cylinder connects to the hemisphere.  The cost of this ring is $\$c/\text{in}$, the cost of the material to create the cylindrical side and bottom is $\$c_b/\text{in}^2$, and the spherical cap costs $\$c_t/\text{in}^2$.  We want to construct this object that has volume $V$ with the minimal cost.  Construct a cost function, $f$, that is dependent on $r$, the radius of the sphere and cylinder.  Your answer should also be dependent on the parameters $c$, $c_t$, $c_b$, $V$.  Find the value of $r$ that will minimize cost given any set of parameter values.  Create a Python file that will build the function $f$ and find the critical point $r$ that yields the least cost given any values of the parameters.  (No figure is needed, your Python file should print out the value of $r$ for any supplied values of $c$, $c_t$, $c_b$, and $V$.) 

\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width = .5\textwidth]{P1_HW2_Figure_3.png}
\end{center}

\textsc{Solution:} The object consists of a cylinder and a hemisphere.  The volume of a cylinder is $\pi r^2 h$ and the volume of a hemisphere is $\frac{2}{3}\pi r^3$.  Therefore, our volume constraint can be used to eliminate the variable $h$: 
\[ \pi r^2 h + \frac{2}{3}\pi r^3 = V \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad h = \frac{V}{\pi r^2} - \frac{2}{3}r.\]
Here, $V$ will act as an input to the system and will join $c, c_t$, and $c_b$ as a parameter.  The total cost of the object is the objective function and depends on the costs of the top hemisphere, the cylindrical siding, bottom circle, and the reinforced ring: 
\[ \text{Total Cost:}\,\, c_b(\pi r^2) + c_b(2\pi r h) + c_t(2\pi r^2) + c(2\pi r). \]
Substituting in our expression for $h$ gives our cost function as 
\begin{align*}
f(r) & = c_b\pi r^2 + 2c_b \pi r \left(\frac{V}{\pi r^2} - \frac{2}{3}r \right) + 2c_t \pi r^2 + 2c \pi r \\ 
\qquad \Rightarrow \quad f(r) & = \left( 2c_t - \frac{1}{3} c_b\right) \pi r^2 + 2c\pi r + \frac{2c_b V}{r} \end{align*}

Given any values of $c, c_t, c_b$, and $V$, this function has a unique minimum value on $r\in(0,\infty)$, provided that the first coefficient is positive, i.e. 
\[ 2c_t - \frac{1}{3}c_b > 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad \frac{c_b}{c_t} < 6, \]
which requires that the cost ratio between the bottom and the top must no more than $6$ to $1$.  That is, if the bottom cost more than 6 times the cost of the top, the cost function does not have a unique minimum value for positive $r$.  In this case, the function may attain both a relative minimum and relative maximum. Assuming the inequality above is achieved, the minimum value occurs at the root of $f'(r)$: 
\[ 2\left( 2c_t - \frac{1}{3} c_b\right) \pi r + 2c\pi - \frac{2c_b V}{r^2} = 0 \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad  2\left( 2c_t - \frac{1}{3} c_b\right) \pi r^3 + 2c\pi r^2 - 2c_b V = 0 , \]
which we can solve for numerically in Python.
